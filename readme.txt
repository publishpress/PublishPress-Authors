PublishPress Authors is the best plugin for adding co-authors, multiple authors and guest authors to WordPress posts.


== Description ==

[PublishPress Authors](https://publishpress.com/authors/) allows you to show an author box at the end of your posts. This author box can display one author, coauthors, multiple authors or even guest authors. This box has the author’s name, avatar, description and more. You can also place the author box in widgets, shortcodes and Gutenberg blocks.

Here are the three most important features of PublishPress Authors:

* **Author Box**. As soon as you install PublishPress Authors, you’ll see an author box under every post. You can add all the profile details you need for each author.
* **Multiple Authors**. By default, WordPress only allows one author per post. PublishPress Authors allows you to add an unlimited number of authors to each post. This is very useful if you have a busy site and need to manage and give credit to coauthors.
* **Guest Authors**. You can create Guest Authors who don’t have an account on your site. This is important because not all writers need a username and password.

On the frontend of your site. PublishPress Authors gives you several different options to display the authors’ box:

* Replacing the default author display.

Using PublishPress Authors, you can create Guest Authors who don’t need an account on your site. PublishPress will treat Guest Authors identically to Authors who are linked users.

= How do I display author boxes and author bios? =

You have several different options for displaying authors using the PublishPress Authors plugin:<br />

1. *Below the content*. Go to Authors > Settings and click the “Display” tab. Check the box saying, “This will display the authors box at the end of the content”. In the “Layout” box, you can choose from several layouts.

= How do I import WordPress users to PublishPress Authors? =

PublishPress Authors does use a different system than the WordPress core, so there may be some work involved with moving author data.

When you first install PublishPress Authors, our plugin will try to import all your authors. However, there may be some more work needed if you have a large site or have been using a different plugin. After installing PublishPress Authors, go to the “Posts” screen to see if your authors have imported correctly.

If you have a very large site with 1,000s or authors or posts, we recommend you use the WP CLI command line system.

[Click here to see how to import WordPress users](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/move-user-guest-authors/).

= How do I import from Co-Authors Plus and Byline plugins? =

PublishPress Authors has a Co-Authors Plus import feature. Co-Authors Plus is a popular but older alternative to PublishPress Authors. This import will bring across all your author profiles. It will also keep track of which posts the authors are associated with. If you want to migrate your site from the CoAuthors Plus plugin, please try this on a test site before attempting it on a live site.

[Click here to see how to import Co-Authors Plus authors](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/co-authors-plus/).

You can import from the the Byline plugin to PublishPress Authors. Start with the old Byline plugin installed on your site. Go to “Authors”, then “Maintenance”. Look for the import option.

[Click here to see how to import Byline authors](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/how-to-import-from-byline-to-multiple-authors/).

= How do I show an author widget? =

The PublishPress Authors plugin provides two widgets.

The “Post Author” widget will display a list of authors for the current post. It is one of several ways that you can show the authors of a post. In your WordPress site, go to Appearance > Widgets. Look for the “Post Author” widget.

[Click here to see how to use the Post Author widget](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/post-author-widget/).

The “Authors List” widget will display a list of all the authors on your site. If you want to show the authors of the post being viewed, try the Post Author widget. In your WordPress site, go to Appearance > Widgets. Look for the “Authors List” widget.

[Click here to see how to use the Authors List widget](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/authors-list-widget/).

= How can I create layouts for Author bio profiles? =

PublishPress Authors provides five default ways to display the author profiles on your site. The Free version allows you to choose any of these layout options. The Pro version allows to modify these defaults and also create new layouts.

In the PublishPress Authors Pro admin area, ggo to Authors > Layouts and you will see all five default layouts: Simple List, Inline with Avatars, Inline, Centered, Boxed. Click “Edit” for any layout and you'll see an editing screen. Each layout is editable using Twig. You can add many different types of author information to these layouts including custom fields.

= Can I use PublishPress Authors with Elementor? =

PublishPress Authors works well with the Elementor plugin. There are 5 options for showing Author profiles on your site. All of these will work with Elementor. However, we have made sure to make sure PublishPress Authors works with inside the main Elementor layout builder. Perhaps the easiest option for the Elementor layout builder is to use the Post Author widget.

= Can I use PublishPress Authors with Divi? =

PublishPress Authors works well with the Divi theme. There are 5 options for showing Author profiles on your site. All of these will work with Divi. We have made sure that PublishPress Authors works with inside the main Divi layout builder. Perhaps the easiest option for the Divi layout builder is to use the Post Author widget.

= How do I integrate PublishPress Authors with my theme? =

The PublishPress Authors plugin allows you to show author profiles using this a snippet of PHP code. This code can be modified in many way to suit your needs. Don't worry if you're not technical. There are also other ways to show your authors that require no code. We recommend that you add these code snippets to a child theme, as that is best practice for WordPress theme development. We do have child themes available for some popular themes.

[Click here to see how to modify the authors output](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/modify-theme-output-authors/).

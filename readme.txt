PublishPress Authors is the best plugin for adding many authors to one WordPress post. You can create multiple authors, co-authors and guest authors.

== Description ==

[PublishPress Authors](https://publishpress.com/authors/) is the best plugin for adding many authors to one WordPress post. You can create multiple authors, co-authors and guest authors.

= Multiple Authors and Co-Authors =

With PublishPress Authors, you can set multiple authors and coauthors for each post. When you write a post, you’ll see a box in the right sidebar. Here you can choose from all the users on your site, and assign them as authors.

On the frontend of your site, PublishPress Authors gives you several different options to display the authors’ box:

* Replacing the default author display.
* At the bottom of your content.
* In a widget or a Gutenberg block.
* Using shortcodes.
* Adding filters and actions in your template files.

= Guest Authors =

Using PublishPress Authors, you can create Guest Authors who don’t need an account on your site. PublishPress will treat Guest Authors identically to Authors who are linked users.

You will be able to select and display Guest Authors in exactly the same way as for registered users. Each Guest Author can have a full profile, plus an avatar, and their own archive page for blog posts.

= Multiple Layout Options for Author Profiles =

PublishPress Authors provides five default ways to display the author profiles on your site.

In the PublishPress Authors settings you can choose from these layouts:

* Simple list
* Boxed
* Centered
* Inline
* Inline with Avatars

[Click here to see details on all the layout options](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/layout/).

= Custom Fields for Author Profiles (Pro version) =

PublishPress Authors Pro enables you to create custom fields and enhance your author profiles.

You can add Text, WYSIWYG, Link and email address fields. Then you can place those fields in author profiles using custom layouts.

= Custom Layouts for Author Profiles (Pro version) =

PublishPress Authors enables you to build custom layouts for your author profiles.

Using all your author information and custom fields, you can design beautiful layouts for your authors. Each layout is editable using Twig. You can add many different types of author information to these layouts including custom fields.

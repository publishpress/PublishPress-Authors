# PublishPress Authors


## Description

By default, WordPress only allows you to add one author to each post. The Multiple Authors add-on allows you to add as many authors you want.

The Multiple authors plugin allows you to add the authors, and also it enables you to display their information. With this add-on, you can show the authors’ names, images and bios.

## Installation

This repository doesn't store external dependencies required by the plugin. It's not possible to simply clone or download the repository code and have a working WordPress plugin.

We aim to follow good practices on development, and we are using Composer as dependency manager, which recommends to not add external dependencies into the repository. You can find more information on their documentation page: [Should I commit the dependencies in my vendor directory?](https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/should-i-commit-the-dependencies-in-my-vendor-directory.md)
